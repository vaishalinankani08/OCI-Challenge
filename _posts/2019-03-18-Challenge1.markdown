About the Challenge
---


This challenge is to verify your ability to create IaaS resources such as
* A managed Kubernetes Service
* Create Network & Firewall policies if required
* Ability to create Users, Compartments, Groups
* Apply Basic Principles of IAM and create access privileges

## What will we Verify here : 
* Have you created a `separate compartment`, and a `user-group` and `user`  with privileges and `policies` to work in only that compartment ?
>  Why ? Because we don't want you messing with other people's work and vice versa
* Spin up the Kubernetes Cluster in the compartment with the User ID 

## Submission format: 
* The `KUBECONFIG` File 
* The credentials of the User created in the `Oracle Cloud Account` in a password protected Zip file
* A Write Up with 5 Bullet points not exceeding 50 words in each point, about the Key Differentiation factors of Oracle Kubernetes engine over AKS and EKS
* Send your Email with
