About this Challenge
---

This challenge is to verify your ability to 
* Use Helm to Deploy Prometheus and Grafana to setup Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring
* Show a dashboard along with alerts on Slack whenever a metric crosses threshold

## About Prometheus
* Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting specializing in Time Series Data
* Prometheus scrapes your Kubernetes Cluster Metrics and stores this information in Memory/ in Disk
* Use this link to understand more about  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)

## About Grafana
* Grafana is an open source platform for Time Series Analytics 
* Use this link to understand more about  [Grafana](http://docs.grafana.org/)

## How do I get started with Prometheus and Grafana
* Prometheus Operator gives you a simple interface to be able define and deploy prometheus and grafana along with Kube state metrics/ Node Exporter / Alert manager etc.
* For more information refer to the readme here https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator


## What will we Verify here : 
* Have you successfully deployed the Prometheus and Grafana using helm status, Verify Prometheus endpoints and targets
* Verify if all Pods are in running state and verify connectivity from within the cluster in Prometheus and Grafana
* Access Prometheus server and grafana dashboards to verify if the data from the cluster is retrievable


## Submission Format: 
* A Write Up with 5 Bullet points not exceeding 50 words in each point, about the `learnings while **deploying on Kubernetes**` using `**helm**`.
* What are your learnings about the prometheus and grafana ecosystem 
* Send your Email with 
  * `Subject Line: OCI Challenge-6`  **< Your Name >**
